## Project: Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning and SVM

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on medical measurements using machine learning. Specifically, we employ the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, renowned for its classification capabilities. The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, a well-known dataset in the medical field.

### Project Structure
This repository contains the following key components:

1. **`Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML-and-SVM/`**: Directory containing the "Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning and SVM" project files.
   - **`diabetes_prediction.py`**: The main script for diabetes prediction.
   - **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python packages.
   - **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
   - **`dataset/`**: Directory containing the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset.
   - **`results/`**: Directory for storing results and logs (if applicable).

### Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-PROJECTS.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ML-PROJECTS/Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML-and-SVM
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dataset
The project utilizes the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. This dataset comprises various medical measurements from women of Pima Indian heritage, aimed at predicting the presence of diabetes.

**Dataset Features:**
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)

**Target Variable:**
- **Outcome**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) for diabetes presence (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic).

### Code Explanation

1. **Dependencies and Imports**
   - Libraries used: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.

2. **Data Collection and Analysis**
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. **Data Standardization**
   - Standardize data to improve SVM performance.

4. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split data into training and testing subsets.

5. **Model Training**
   - Train an SVM model using a linear kernel.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy on both training and testing data.

7. **Predictive System**
   - Provide a system to predict diabetes status based on new medical measurements.

### Usage

1. **Run the Prediction Script**:
   ```bash
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```

2. **Input Medical Measurements**: Enter the required data as prompted.

3. **Receive Prediction**: The system will output whether the person is diabetic or non-diabetic.

### Results
The model's performance is evaluated by accuracy scores:

- **Training Accuracy**: Accuracy on the training data.
- **Testing Accuracy**: Accuracy on the test data.

### Future Enhancements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Explore different kernels and parameters for improved accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Investigate new features or transformations.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation for model robustness.
