## Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning, using SVM

### Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various medical measurements. The prediction model is built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, known for its effectiveness in classification tasks. The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, a well-known dataset in the medical field.

### Project Structure
The project consists of the following sections:

1. **Dependencies and Imports**: Lists the Python libraries and packages needed to run the code.
2. **Data Collection and Analysis**: Involves loading the dataset, understanding its structure, and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. **Data Standardization**: Standardizes the data to ensure better performance of the SVM model.
4. **Train-Test Split**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
5. **Model Training**: Trains the SVM model using the training data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's accuracy on both the training and testing datasets.
7. **Predictive System**: Demonstrates how the trained model can predict whether a new patient is diabetic or non-diabetic.

### Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-ml.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction-ml
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. It consists of various medical measurements taken from a group of women of Pima Indian heritage. The goal is to predict the presence of diabetes based on these measurements.

**Columns/Features:**

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)

**Target Variable:**

- **Outcome**: Binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

### Code Explanation

1. **Dependencies and Imports**
   - The following Python libraries are used in this project:
     - `numpy`: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
     - `pandas`: For data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
     - `scikit-learn`: A machine learning library used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Data Collection and Analysis**
   - The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Initial exploration is done to understand the structure and distribution of the data. This includes checking the shape, getting statistical summaries, and visualizing the distribution of the target variable (Outcome).

3. **Data Standardization**
   - Standardization is a crucial step in preprocessing. The features are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which improves the performance of the SVM model.

4. **Train-Test Split**
   - The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets. This helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring that the model generalizes well.

5. **Model Training**
   - The SVM model is initialized with a linear kernel and trained on the standardized training data. The SVM algorithm finds the optimal hyperplane that separates diabetic from non-diabetic cases.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - The accuracy of the model is calculated on both the training and testing data. The accuracy score measures how well the model is performing, indicating the proportion of correctly classified instances.

7. **Predictive System**
   - A predictive system is created that allows the user to input medical measurements and get a prediction on whether the person is diabetic or not. The input data is standardized before being fed into the model to ensure consistency.

### Usage
After setting up the environment and running the code, you can use the predictive system to predict whether a person is diabetic based on their medical measurements. Here's how you can use it:

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```

2. Input data: Enter the required medical measurements as prompted.

3. Get Prediction: The system will output whether the person is diabetic or not.

### Results
The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy scores on the training and testing data. These scores indicate how well the model has learned to classify patients correctly.

- **Training Accuracy**: Indicates how well the model fits the training data.
- **Testing Accuracy**: Indicates how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

### Future Enhancements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different kernels and parameters to further improve the model's accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore new features or transformations that could provide better insights and improve model performance.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and stability.
